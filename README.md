Good coding to have  
Here **25 notes** for good coding practice that I have to thanks to https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gaAoJBMJ_Q&t=389s

1. Writing to a csv with unnecessary index here  
2. Avoid column name that include spaces here
* Leveraging the query method here
* Using variables instead of the string method to formulate the query strings
* Using override when possible instead of inplace = True
Use vectorization instead of iterating over rows in a dataframe
Using vectorization as an option instead using apply method (when possible)
Avoid considering a slice of a dataframe as it were a new dataframe
Use chaining commands and avoid creating multiple intermediate dataframes when making transformations
Properly set columns dtypes
Using boolean value instead of string
Leveraging pandas built in plotting methods
Avoid manually applying string methods
Avoid repeating commonly used data transformation
Use dictionary for renaming columns
Aggregating by groups not manually but with group by
Looping over the rows to create aggregates
Avoid if possible using a loop to calculate how values changes
Saving large datasets as csv
Apply style to dataframe like in excel
Setting proper suffixes when merging 2 dataframes
Checking consistency after merging 2 dataframes
Stacking chained commands into one line of code
Using categorical data types
Be aware of creating duplicated label columns
Memory optimization
