Good coding to have  
Here **25 notes** for good coding practice that I have to thanks to https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gaAoJBMJ_Q&t=389s

1. Writing to a csv with unnecessary index here  
2. Avoid column name that include spaces here
3. Leveraging the query method here
4. Using variables instead of the string method to formulate the query strings
5. Using override when possible instead of inplace = True
6. Use vectorization instead of iterating over rows in a dataframe
7. Using vectorization as an option instead using apply method (when possible)
8. Avoid considering a slice of a dataframe as it were a new dataframe
9. Use chaining commands and avoid creating multiple intermediate dataframes when making transformations
10. Properly set columns dtypes
11. Using boolean value instead of string
12. Leveraging pandas built in plotting methods
13. Avoid manually applying string methods
14. Avoid repeating commonly used data transformation
15. Use dictionary for renaming columns
16. Aggregating by groups not manually but with group by
17. Looping over the rows to create aggregates
18. Avoid if possible using a loop to calculate how values changes
19. Saving large datasets as csv
20. Apply style to dataframe like in excel
21. Setting proper suffixes when merging 2 dataframes
22. Checking consistency after merging 2 dataframes
23. Stacking chained commands into one line of code
24. Using categorical data types
25. Be aware of creating duplicated label columns
26. Memory optimization
